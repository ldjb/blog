### 1. Norway
Funky music with gimmicky visuals.

### 2. Romania
Unpleasant song with creepy mannequins.

### 3. Serbia
Started off like a traditional Serbian song, which was promptly ruined when it became a pop song.

### 4. San Marino
The dancing robots were cool. It's a shame the song was painful to listen to.

### 5. Denmark
This definitely had Viking vibes and certainly was not bad. Though not outstanding either.
