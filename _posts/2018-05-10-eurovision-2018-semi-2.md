Here are my thoughts on each of the acts in the second semi-final of 2018's Eurovision Song Contest.

### 1. Norway
Funky music with gimmicky visuals.

### 2. Romania
Unpleasant song with creepy mannequins.

### 3. Serbia
Started off like a traditional Serbian song, which was promptly ruined when it became a pop song.

### 4. San Marino
The dancing robots were cool. It's a shame the song was painful to listen to.

### 5. Denmark
This definitely had Viking vibes and certainly was not bad. Though not outstanding either.

### 6. Russia
I didn't care for the song, but the staging and choreography was… pleasant.

### 7. Moldova
Moldova always puts on a good show, and this year was no different. The song was decent, but the choreography and staging was quite possibly the best of the competition so far this year. I liked how their outfits reflected the colours of the Moldovan flag.

### 8. Netherlands
Pretty good song, though what was with all the crazy dancing?! It did not look pleasant.

### 9. Australia
Australia is totally part of Europe, right? Anyway, the song was bland, but the staging and choreography were pretty good.

### 10. Georgia
A mediocre performance.

### 11. Poland
My ears hurt… The lighting was nice, though.

### 12. Malta
Weird, but I quite liked it!

### 13. Hungary
My ears hurt again…

### 14. Latvia
Dull.

### 15. Sweden
It was okay. Quite nice, visually.

### 16. Montenegro
Another fairly boring song.

### 17. Slovenia
Not very pleasant, but it had style, at least. Oh, and the fake technical issues were so cringeworthy…

### 18. Ukraine
I quite liked it. Good performance.
