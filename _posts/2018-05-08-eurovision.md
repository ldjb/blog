The first semi-final of 2018's Eurovision Song Contest has started!

I am currently live-blogging my thoughts on each of the acts.

### 1. Azerbaijan

Not a bad song, but not a particularly interesting one, either. Some nice staging and choreography, but not exceptional.

### 2. Iceland

Absolutely cringeworthy song. Nice suit, though.

### 3. Albania
Not unpleasant.

### 4. Belgium
Weird song. Weird performance. Weird staging. I'm not sure I liked it, exactly, but it was interesting, at least.

### 5. Czech Republic
Not really my sort of music, but the performance was crazy enough that this has got to be my favourite of the evening so far.

### 6. Lithuania
Boring song, but the way video clips of …seemingly random people… were overlayed on top of the live performance was quite interesting.
